# Introduction

## REVO Opacity Cutout Blender Addon

REVO Opacity Cutout converts texture masks into clean cutout geometry directly in Blender, making it easier to create game-ready foliage and decals. Built for Unreal Engine 5 workflows with Nanite in mind, it can also be used with SpeedTree and includes vertex painter tools for advanced wind setup on trees and vegetation.

The foliage vertex paint workflow is inspired by the Megascans vegetation material workflow shown in [this reference video](https://youtu.be/6qtqVPqiwI4). The system is designed to work with Megascans UE5 vegetation materials as well as similar custom foliage shaders.

## Main Features

- 2D / Planar Cutout mode for fast contour-based cutouts on flat cards
- 3D / Grid Mask mode for curved meshes where preserving surface flow matters
- 3D / Precise mode for high-accuracy cutouts on non-planar geometry (for example canopies)
- Built-in quality presets for quick setup and consistent results
- Optional advanced controls for contour cleanup and triangulation behavior
- Integrated vertex painter tools for RGBA foliage channel workflows
- The original source mesh is never modified. All edits are performed on a duplicate, which is marked in the Outliner with a suffix such as `_Cutout or _PreciseCut`
- One-click dependency installer from inside the panel

## N-Panel

Use the N-Panel workflow:

- Open `3D View > N-Panel > REV OpacityCutout`
- Select mask image and channel
- Choose a quality preset
- Run one of the Generate actions

### Main operators you will use

| Action | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Generate Cutout (2D / Planar) | Main contour pipeline |
| Generate 3D Cutout (Grid Mask) | Face-sampling mode on source mesh |
| Generate 3D Precise Cut | UV clip + reprojection workflow |


## Required Dependencies

These Python packages are required for the add-on to function correctly:

| Dependency | Why it is required |
| --- | --- |
| `opencv-python` | Image processing for mask analysis and cutout preparation |
| `pyclipper` | Polygon clipping/offset operations used during contour cleanup |

Use the **Install Dependencies** button in the add-on panel to install both packages automatically if they are missing.

## Required Blender version

- Supported Blender versions: 4.0 to 5.1
- Recommended: Blender 4.2+
- Add-on version: 1.0.0
